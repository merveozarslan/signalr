In todayâ€™s rapid world, where making decisions and gaining real time insights are crucial, this project introduces an innovative Sales Display Project that aims to enhance the performance of sales teams. This is achieved in my project by integrating SignalR, a modern real-time communication library with a SQL database infrastructure. The project seeks to revolutionize sales analytics by providing updates and dynamic visualizations creating an agile environment, for the sales team.
The main objectives of this research involve designing and implementing a sales display system that delivers updates on key sales values. This system aims to foster collaboration and ensure that everyone in the team is well informed. Through SignalRs event driven architecture the project enables notification of sales activities equipping the sales team, with the current information available.
